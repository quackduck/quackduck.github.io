    <h1>Harmonic Series Calculator</h1>
    <p class="text">
      The Harmonic series is:
      <br>
      <span class="mono">1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5...</span>
      <br>
      <br>
      It is a divergent series, which means that the partial sums of this series do not approach a fixed value. Instead, the sum either continually increases or decreases. In this case, the sum increases even though each new term of the series gets
      smaller and smaller.
      <br>
      <br>
      You might say this is because infinitely many numbers are added. However there are sequences whose partial sums approach a fixed value. An example of this is the sequence:
      <br>
      <span class="mono">1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16...</span>
      <br>
      The partial sums of this sequence approaches (but never crosses) 2
      <br>
      <br>
      Proof of divergence:
      <br>
      <span class="mono">1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8...</span>
      <br>
      <span class="mono">1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8...</span>
      <br>
      The first sequence is greater than the second.
      <br>
      The infinite sum of the second sequence is infinity
      <br>
      Therefore, the infinite sum of the first sequence is also infinity.

      Enter a number to calculate the sum of the series to that many values

      Enter a number to calculate at which number the sum is more than or equal to your number (the opposite of the first calculator)
