        <h2>The Burj Khalifa</h2>
        Dubai's landmark building is the Burj Khalifa, which at 829.8 meters is the tallest building in the world. For most visitors, a trip to the observation deck on the 124th floor here is a must-do while in the city. The views across the city
        skyline from this higher than bird's-eye view are incredible. The observation deck experience includes a presentation on both Dubai and the the Burj was built (completed in 2010) before a high-speed elevator(one of the fastest!) speeds you up
        to the observation deck for those 360-degree views out across the skyscrapers to the desert on one side and the ocean on the other.
        <br><br>
        Nighttime visits are particularly popular with photographers due to Dubai's famous city-lights panoramas. Buy your Burj Khalifa "At the Top" Entrance Ticket in advance to avoid long line-ups, especially if you are planning to visit on a
        weekend.
        <br><br>
        Back on the ground, wrapping around the Burj Khalifa, are the building's beautifully designed gardens, with winding walkways. There are plenty of water features including the Dubai Fountain, the world's tallest performing fountain.

        <h2>The Dubai Mall</h2>
        Dubai Mall is the city's premier mall and is how you enter the Burj Khalifa, as well as the Dubai Aquarium. There is also an ice-skating rink, gaming zone, and cinema complex if you're looking for more entertainment options. The shopping and
        eating is endless, and there are nearly always special events such as live music and fashion shows within the mall. The most famous of these are the annual Dubai Shopping Festival in January and February and the Dubai Summer
        Surprises Festival in July and August.

        <h2>Dubai Frame</h2>

        Sitting right between Dubai's older neighborhoods clustered around the creek and the city's modern sprawl, this enormous 150-meter-high picture frame is one of Dubai's latest sights. Inside, a series of galleries show you through the city's
        history and explore Emirati heritage before you travel up to the Sky Deck, where there are fantastic panoramas of both old and new Dubai to be snapped on the viewing platforms.

        <h2>Dubai Creek</h2> 

        Dubai Creek separates the city into two towns, with Deira to the north and Bur Dubai to the south. The creek has been very important to the city's growth, attracting settlers to fish and pearl dive. Small villages grew along the creek 4,000
        years ago, while the modern era began in the 1830s when the Bani Yas tribe settled in the area.
        <br><br>
        Still used by small traders, some of the dhows here are over 100 years old. Dhow workers often invite visitors onto the vessels, where you can look into the life of these traditional sailors. Many of the dhows travel to Kuwait, Iran, Oman,
        India, and down to Africa's horn.
        <br><br>
        On the Bur Dubai side of the creek is the Al Seef district, with a waterfront promenade backed by traditional coral-block and limestone buildings, a floating market, and many craft shops.

        <h2>Sheikh Zayed Road</h2>
        Sheikh Zayed Road is the main artery running through Dubai's most important attractions. This wide, eight-lane highway is surrounded with gigantic skyscrapers. It's the best point for Dubai's skyscraper views.
        <br><br>
        Most of Dubai's famous malls are located along the road's route. The Dubai World Trade Tower has an observation deck on its top floor, which offers visitors panoramic views, and the Gold and Diamond Park is a must see for jewelry lovers, with
        118 manufacturers and 30 retailers.

        <h2>Dubai Aquarium</h2>
        The Dubai Aquarium houses 140 species of sea life in the huge suspended tank on the ground floor of the Dubai Mall. As well as free viewing from the mall, if you enter the Underwater Zoo, you can walk through the aquarium tunnels.
        <br><br>
        Different activities help you get a closer look at the sea life. Glass bottom boat tours (on top of the tank) are very popular. Cage snorkeling and shark diving activities are also available.

        <h2>Burj al Arab</h2>

        The Burj Al-Arab is the world's tallest hotel, standing 321 meters high on its own artificial island. Designed to resemble a dhow sail, the exterior of the building is lit up by a colored light show at night.
        <h2>Jumeirah Beach</h2>

        This beautiful white sand beach is the number one beach destination for Dubai visitors. Hotels are strung out all along its length. The beach has plenty of sun loungers, restaurants, and water sports operators offering jet skiing.
        <h2>Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary</h2>


        You don't have to go too far away from the skyscrapers to relax in some nature. The Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary even has the mangrove forests and wetlands of Dubai creek. An important stop on the migration routes, it's a good place to spot
        flamingos in winter when massive flocks wade through the lagoons, backdropped by high-rises.

        <h2>Mall of the Emirates</h2>
        Mall of the Emirates is one of the city's most famous malls, with the spectacular Ski Dubai inside. The indoor ski slope is complete with chairlifts and a penguin enclosure, all at a continuous temperature of -4 degrees Celsius. There's also
        a cinema complex and a family entertainment center with a whole host of rides aimed at both the big and small. The shopping opportunities are boundless, as are the eating options, offering every conceivable world cuisine.

        <h2>Dubai Parks and Resorts</h2>

        At Dubai Parks and Resorts, all entertainment needs are fulfilled. The only problem is choosing what you want to do. Motiongate takes its theme from Hollywood productions, with rides based around movies; Bollywood Parks brings the world of
        India's famous movie industry; and Legoland Dubai and Legoland Waterpark dont need an introduction. Nearby beautiful Riverland Dubai being a dining hub means that there's no need to leave after you've exhausted yourself with theme park
        pursuits, as there's plenty of evening entertainment here as well.

        <h2>Aquaventure</h2>
        This waterpark, based at Atlantis, The Palm on the Palm Jumeirah — Dubai's famous man-made island — is a great place to cool off. The waterslide action here is excellent and world-class, with the Aquaconda, the world's longest water slide; a
        nine-story-tall slide, aptly named the Leap of Faith; and water coaster rides. There's also underwater safaris using Sea TREK helmets; a dedicated water play area for smaller children with slides; and for when all your energy has been used
        up, a 700-meter sweep of white-sand beach.

        dubai miracle garden
        This is the zaniest garden ever. Not content with constructing the world's largest buildings and malls, Dubai has created the world's largest flower garden, spanning 2,000 square meters and home to a reputed 100 million flowers. Everything
        that can be covered with flowers has been, from twee English-style cottages to windmills and trucks. There's even a flower version of the Burj Khalifa. Stroll the walkways and enjoy the riot of color and the wacky flower displays.
